# SAIFEGuard 🛡️ – Empowering Independent Aging with Agentic AI

**SAIFEGuard** is a GenAI-powered, multi-agent system built to provide 24/7 proactive care for elderly individuals living independently. Developed during the **"Hack the Future: A Gen AI Sprint Powered by Data"** hackathon, this project combines the power of generative AI, wearable tech, and autonomous agents to reimagine elder care with empathy and innovation.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

In a rapidly aging world, millions of seniors live alone, facing health risks, social isolation, and gaps in care. With healthcare systems stretched thin, how can we ensure they live longer, healthier, and more connected lives—without full dependence on human caregivers?

## 💡 Our Solution

**SAIFEGuard** is a multi-agent GenAI ecosystem that acts as:
- 👩‍⚕️ **Health Agent** – Continuously monitors vitals, flags anomalies.
- ⏰ **Routine Agent** – Sends smart reminders (medications, hydration, appointments).
- 🧠 **Behavioral Agent** – Detects unusual inactivity or movement and triggers alerts.
- 📞 **Caregiver Agent** – Bridges communication between the elderly, family, and healthcare providers.

These agents work collaboratively and autonomously using **agentic AI**, creating a personalized and intelligent safety net.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
